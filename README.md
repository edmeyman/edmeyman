## What I'm Building

Open, vendor-neutral standards for **AI governance that can be independently verified**—not documented and trusted.

**Core thesis:** Shift governance from policy statements and process documentation to **mechanically checkable proof objects** with **replayable verification**. If you can't replay the decision, you can't audit it. If you can't audit it, you can't govern it.

This approach treats governance as a **runtime property of the system**, not an after-the-fact reporting function.

This work centers on **Proof-Carrying Decisions (PCDs)**—cryptographically signed artifacts that carry their own verification evidence, enabling **fail-closed governance** where actions are blocked unless provably authorized.

## Open Standards

### [4TS Standard](https://github.com/edmeyman/4ts-standard)

The **Four Tests Standard (4TS)** is a vendor-neutral specification for deterministic AI governance, oriented around Proof-Carrying Decisions:

- **Stop** — Can the system provably refuse an action?
- **Ownership** — Can the authority behind a decision be proven?
- **Replay** — Can the decision be mechanically reproduced and verified?
- **Escalation** — Can unresolved or unauthorized actions be deterministically routed?

4TS defines **what must be provable** for an AI system to be governable in regulated environments.

## [AI Governance Executive Guide Series](https://github.com/edmeyman/ai-governance-guides)

A decision-grade guide series for executives, regulators, and system owners responsible for deploying AI in regulated environments.

The series translates deterministic governance principles into **actionable authorization models**, clarifying:

- What must be *provable* vs. what can be merely *documented*
- Where traditional compliance frameworks fail
- Why logs, audits, and attestations are insufficient as evidence
- How to operationalize fail-closed authorization for AI systems

**Selected guides include:**

- *From Compliance Artifacts to Proof-Carrying Decisions*
- *Why Logs Are Not Evidence*
- *Determinism vs. Authorization: A Governance Boundary*
- *The Four Tests Standard (4TS) — An Executive Primer*

> Written for leaders who must **authorize AI systems**, not merely oversee them.

## FERZ Intellectual Property Portfolio

Patent-pending governance infrastructure with claims spanning multiple mathematical approaches to deterministic verification and authorization.

Each system addresses a **distinct failure mode** in AI accountability, escalation, or authorization under regulatory constraints.

Representative systems include:

- **LASO(f)** — Linguistic policy enforcement kernel  
- **DELIA** — Decision lineage, authorization, and escalation infrastructure  
- **DAGS-CVCA** — Constitutional verification for AI systems  
- **STRATA-G** — Structured governance architecture for regulated AI

These systems operationalize 4TS principles across healthcare, financial services, government, and defense environments, complemented by defensive publications establishing foundational prior art.

## How to Read This Repository

- **Standards** define *what must be provable*
- **Systems** show *how proof is generated and enforced*
- **Publications** explain *why existing approaches fail*

This repository is intended to be read as **governance architecture**, not product documentation.

---

## Looking For

- **Standards adoption** — Organizations implementing verifiable governance frameworks
- **Pilot customers** — Regulated enterprises ready to move beyond compliance theater
- **Collaborators** — Researchers and engineers working on deterministic governance, formal methods, or regulatory technology

## 🚀 Current Focus

Building open-source standards for **deterministic AI governance** in healthcare, finance, and defense. Creating vendor-neutral infrastructure that enables organizations to prove—not just claim—AI accountability through mechanical verification.

**Core Innovation:** Shifting AI governance from aspirational principles to mathematically verifiable proof systems, similar to how TCP/IP became foundational internet infrastructure.

## 🔬 Research & Publications

### Academic Papers

**[Verifiable AI Governance: The Four Tests Standard (4TS) and Proof-Carrying Decisions](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5688982)**  
*SSRN, October 2025*

Introduces formal specification for mechanically verifiable AI governance. Establishes four necessary and sufficient conditions (Stop, Ownership, Replay, Escalation) and operationalizes them through Proof-Carrying Decision (PCD) objects.

### Patents & IP Portfolio

**Patent Holder:** Multiple innovations in deterministic AI governance:
- **LASO(f)** - Linguistic governance framework
- **DAGS-CVCA** - Constitutional verification for AI systems
- **DELIA/DELIA-AG** - Decision escalation and lineage infrastructure
- **Constitutional Blockchain** - Immutable audit trails for governance
- **STRATA-G** - Structured governance architectures

## 🛠️ Key Open-Source Projects

### [Four Tests Standard (4TS)](https://github.com/edmeyman/4ts-standard)

Vendor-neutral technical specification for verifiable AI governance. Enables organizations to prove compliance through:
- **Proof-Carrying Decisions (PCDs):** Cryptographically-signed governance artifacts
- **Deterministic Verification:** Mathematical acceptance criteria
- **Dual Replay Modes:** State-Replay (byte-exact) and Protocol-Replay (gate-based)
- **Fail-Closed Design:** Actions blocked by default unless provably approved

**License:** CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (specification) + MIT (schemas/code)

## 💼 Professional Background

### FERZ LLC | Founder & CEO
*Building category-defining infrastructure for deterministic AI governance*

**Mission:** Enable mechanical verification of AI accountability claims in regulated industries where governance failures have material consequences (healthcare decisions, financial approvals, safety-critical systems).

**Approach:** Open standards with patent-protected implementation advantages—similar to how standards bodies operate—driving adoption while maintaining competitive moats through expertise.

### Federal IT Leadership
*20+ years experience in government technology programs*

Deep understanding of regulatory environments, compliance requirements, and enterprise deployment constraints that inform FERZ's governance architecture.

## 🎯 Strategic Vision

**The Problem:** Current AI governance frameworks rely on organizational self-assessment and documentation theater. They ask "Does governance exist?" rather than "Can governance claims be proven under adversarial inspection?"

**The Solution:** Deterministic verification infrastructure that enables independent auditors to mechanically validate governance claims, transforming AI oversight from narrative to proof.

**The Opportunity:** Establishing governance as core infrastructure layer—the missing piece between frontier AI capabilities and enterprise deployment in regulated environments.

## 💡 Philosophy

> "Governance without verification is theater. Verification without determinism is sampling. We need infrastructure that can survive adversarial inspection—not just friendly audits."

Building systems where accountability is mechanically provable, not organizationally claimed. Creating the TCP/IP layer for AI governance.

**Founder & CEO, FERZ LLC** — building verifiable AI governance infrastructure for regulated industries (**AI compliance, auditability, policy enforcement**).

## What I'm Building

Open, vendor-neutral standards for **AI governance that can be independently verified**—not documented and trusted.

**Core thesis:** Shift governance from policy statements and process documentation to **mechanically checkable proof objects** with **replayable verification**. If you can't replay the decision, you can't audit it. If you can't audit it, you can't govern it.

This work centers on **Proof-Carrying Decisions (PCDs)**—cryptographically signed artifacts that carry their own verification evidence, enabling **fail-closed governance** where actions are blocked unless provably authorized.

## Open Standards

### [4TS Standard](https://github.com/edmeyman/4ts-standard)

The **Four Tests Standard** is a vendor-neutral specification for deterministic AI governance (PCD-oriented): **Stop, Ownership, Replay, Escalation**.

## FERZ Intellectual Property Portfolio

Patent-pending governance infrastructure with claims across multiple mathematical approaches to deterministic verification. Representative systems include:

- **LASO(f)** — Linguistic policy enforcement kernel  
- **DELIA** — Decision lineage and escalation infrastructure  
- **DAGS-CVCA** — Constitutional verification for AI systems  
- **STRATA-G** — Structured governance architecture  

Complemented by defensive publications establishing foundational prior art in AI governance. These and other systems operationalize 4TS principles for regulated industries including healthcare, financial services, and defense.

## Looking For

- **Standards adoption** — Organizations implementing verifiable governance frameworks  
- **Pilot customers** — Regulated enterprises ready to move beyond compliance theater  
- **Collaborators** — Researchers/engineers working on deterministic governance, formal methods, or regulatory technology

> Governance without verification is theater. Verification without determinism is sampling.
